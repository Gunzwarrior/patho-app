# PROGRESS.md — current state (verify against real `git log` first)

**This document can go stale the moment a commit happens without it being
updated.** Neither Claude nor this file has live access to the actual repo
— before relying on anything below, ask the person to paste
`git log --oneline -20` (or however far back is useful) and reconcile.
Where this doc says "committed," that's based on the conversation's own
memory of agreeing on a commit message, not a verified fact.

This round also mixed tools for the first time: some of what's below was
built in a Claude.ai chat, some in Cline against the Claude API directly,
some the person did by hand. Noted per item, since it's new territory for
how this file gets kept honest — see near the bottom for the open
question that raises.

## Where we are right now (read this first)

Everything below is confirmed working in the person's real browser — he
ran the updated `init_db.py` himself, reseeded, and tested. **Nothing in
this batch has been committed yet**, but unlike earlier in this round,
none of it is provisional: this is ready to commit.

## Currently mid-task

Nothing in progress right now — this session's work is fully done and
verified, just waiting on commit (see above). When a task starts that
might outlast a session, note the plan and checkpoints here as it goes,
not just at the end — see CLAUDE.md's "Checkpointing vs. committing" for
why. Clear this section once the task is genuinely done.

## Fixed and verified this round

- **Gallbladder cholesterolosis blank-line bug** (Claude.ai chat). Root
  cause: the separator after `{% if cholesterolosis %}...{% endif %}`
  sat outside the conditional, so it rendered unconditionally even when
  the sentence inside didn't. Fixed in `seed_data.py` by moving the
  separator inside/adjacent-only-when-true. Audited all four case types
  for the same pattern — no other instance existed (every other
  conditional in these templates has no empty branch to begin with).
  Verified via direct function calls: all 64 combinations of
  Gallbladder's `cholesterolosis` × `lithiasis` × `inflammation_type` ×
  `specimen_state`.
- **Gallbladder + Appendix compactness** (Claude.ai chat). Descriptive
  microscopy prose was blank-line-separated between sentences; now reads
  as continuous prose (single spaces), matching the real `CR_Sample.docx`
  samples. Verified via direct function calls: all 64 Gallbladder + all
  12 Appendix combinations.
- **`{{ snippet('absence_malignite') }}` placement** (Claude.ai chat, on
  request). Sits on its own line directly under the microscopy
  description — a hard newline, not a blank-line paragraph break.
- **Preset-switch reset was wiping Case ID / Renseignements cliniques**
  (Cline + Claude API, refining the prior session's preset-switch fix).
  The prior fix correctly cleared stale Block field values on any preset
  change, but routed through the same `_do_workspace_reset` used for a
  full reset — and `_clear_case_scoped_state()` bumps `_form_generation`,
  which orphans the generation-scoped `case_id_{gen}` / `clin_info_{gen}`
  widget keys even though nothing explicitly deletes them. Fixed with a
  dedicated `_do_preset_switch_reset` flag that captures both values
  under the old generation before clearing, then re-seeds them under the
  new generation — same pattern already used for case-reopen restoration.
  Verified via `AppTest`: the exact `etc0`→`etc5` scenario with Case ID
  and Renseignements cliniques typed in first now preserves both, and a
  regression check confirms the original stale-field-value fix still
  holds through the new path.
- **"MICROSCOPY:" label and case number removed from the rendered
  report** (person's own manual edit in `rendering.py`). Neither appears
  in any real sample. Re-verified in this chat: compiles clean, full
  shell render confirmed correct with both lines gone.
- **Unused `case_id` parameter cleaned up** (person's own manual edit,
  after the "MICROSCOPY:"/case-number removal left it unused in
  `assemble_report_html`). Not reproduced in this chat's copy of the
  files — the person did this directly in his own repo, and it's
  behavior-neutral, so there's nothing to verify beyond what he's already
  confirmed working.

### "Examen macroscopique" / "Examen microscopique" headers — architecture change, now fully applied and verified

The first attempt (hardcoding the headers into `seed_data.py`'s template
text) was wrong — confirmed against `CR_Sample.docx`, which the person
provided with two real cases (single-specimen Gallbladder, two-specimen
Gallbladder+Sleeve). The two-specimen case has **no** "Examen..." labels
anywhere; each specimen just gets its existing numbered "N. Name" header
followed by macro text, one blank line, then micro text. Headers only
belong to the single-specimen case, which also drops the specimen-name
header entirely (the title already covers it) — a template can't know
its own specimen count, so this can't live in template text at all.

**Schema change**: new nullable column `Blocks.macro_template`. This is
**universal** across every non-table block, not a per-block-type opt-in
— an earlier version of this same round first framed it as "Gastric Trio
opts out forever," which the person caught and corrected: fragment_text
is a genuine macro statement (specimen count received), just previously
folded unlabeled into `micro_template` — splitting it out doesn't change
today's 3-block Gastric Trio output at all (`render_block`'s
multi-specimen path recombines `macro_txt + "\n\n" + micro_txt`,
confirmed byte-identical to the old folded template), but it means a
future single-specimen preset of *any* kind (e.g. an antrum-alone
biopsy) correctly gets the same header treatment as
Gallbladder/Appendix/Thyroid, rather than needing special-casing later.
`macro_template=NULL` stays supported for a block with genuinely no
macro content to state, but isn't expected to be the normal case — every
current block (all 4 case types) has one set. The one real exception,
not yet built: `is_table` blocks (prostate biopsies) — a fundamentally
different, row-based rendering path outside this mechanism entirely.

**Rendering change**: `rendering.render_block` takes a new
`total_specimens` argument (`workspace.py` passes `len(blocks)`). When
`macro_template` is set, it renders macro and micro separately, then
combines them: 1 specimen → headers, 2 blank lines around each, header
hugs its own content; 2+ specimens → no headers, one blank line between
macro and micro, wrapped in the existing numbered specimen header.
`format_micro_plain` drops the specimen-name header entirely (not just
its number) when there's exactly one specimen — an earlier pass in this
round only stripped the "1." prefix, which was half right.

**Shell fixes, same evidence**: title-to-content gap is 2 blank lines,
not 1 (`assemble_report_html` only had `<br><br>`). "Renseignements
cliniques :" is now omitted entirely when `clinical_info` is empty,
rather than rendering as a label with nothing after it.

**Testing**: verified against the real sample paragraph-by-paragraph
(extracted from the docx XML directly, not eyeballed from a render) —
matches exactly for the single-specimen case. Verified through the
actual `init_db.py` → `seed_data.seed_all()` flow (not a hand-built test
schema): all 64 Gallbladder + 12 Appendix + 5 Thyroid + 3 Gastric Trio
(duodenum/antrum/fundus individually) single-specimen combinations
produce exactly one of each header with no stray blank lines; the
existing 3-specimen Gastric Trio preset's output is byte-identical to
its pre-split output; a synthetic two-specimen case (Gallbladder +
Appendix together, since Sleeve isn't a real block yet) produces zero
"Examen..." labels and correct "1./2." specimen headers instead,
matching the Sleeve sample's structure. **Since then, the person ran the
updated `init_db.py` himself against his real `pathology.db` and
confirmed everything works as intended in his actual browser.**

## Overall shape

The plan has two tiers:
- **Tier 1 — foundation**: schema, reopen mechanism, real pending/validated
  status, Worklist, the two-button Save split. **Complete.**
- **Tier 2 — breadth**: build out real case types (content), using the
  now-stable engine. **In progress** — 4 case types built, now matching
  real report samples structurally (macro/micro headers, numbering,
  compactness) after this round's work. Content-level items below still
  open.
- **Tier 3 (informal) — self-service**: the Editor UI. **Not started** —
  deliberately deferred until Tier 2's content settles further, since
  building the Editor against templates that are still actively changing
  would mean re-doing Editor work too.

## Content/design requests, not yet implemented

- **A separate, editable "Title" field**, pre-filled per Preset but not
  identical to the Preset's internal `name`. Examples: Gastric Trio's
  title should default to "Biopsies gastroduodénales"; Thyroid Cytology's
  defaults to "Cytologie thyroïdienne" but is routinely hand-extended per
  case (e.g. "Cytologie thyroïdienne lobaire gauche") — must stay freely
  editable, not locked to the preset default. Appendix and Gallbladder's
  current titles are already fine as-is. Implementation sketch: add
  `Presets.default_title` (nullable TEXT), a new Title widget in
  Workspace pre-filled from it, wired into `assemble_report_html` in
  place of `preset["name"]`.

## Genuinely new architectural question — needs a real decision, not just a fix

- **Field-consistency validation.** Example: selecting "fausses
  membranes" on Appendix shouldn't be combinable with mild severity
  levels (`endo`, `suppuree`) or `intervalle` — clinically inconsistent.
  Two options on the table: prevent the invalid combination outright
  (dynamically restrict `appendicite_type` options based on
  `false_membranes`), or at minimum show an inconsistency warning.
  Neither exists in the current architecture. The warn-and-confirm
  pattern already built for the duplicate-case guard is the likely
  reusable template for the "warning" option, but this is a real design
  decision, not a quick patch — likely to recur for other organs' field
  combinations. **Discuss before building.**

## Open question: keeping this file honest across tools

The person is trialing a mixed workflow — this Claude.ai chat when free,
Cline + Claude API or OpenRouter credits when the free tier is hit — to
compare costs against a Pro-plan Claude Code subscription before
committing to one. Two things surfaced this round worth carrying forward:
reconstructing a fix pasted in from another tool (the preset-switch
preservation fix) took comparing it line-by-line against the local file
to figure out precisely what changed and why — doable for one fix, but
the effort scales with how much gets batched before syncing; and this
round also included manual edits the person made directly in his own
repo (case number/"MICROSCOPY:" removal, the `case_id` param cleanup)
that got described in prose rather than reproduced in this chat's files.
Both point the same direction: whoever makes a change — tool or person —
is in the best position to record it accurately, right when it happens,
rather than deferring reconstruction to whichever session syncs next.

## Immediate next steps, if resuming without other instructions

1. Ask for `git log` to establish real state, and confirm what's actually
   committed vs. what's staged from this round.
2. Raise the field-consistency architectural question explicitly and get
   a real decision before building anything for it.
3. Remaining open items: the Title field.
4. Don't start the Editor (Tier 3) until Tier 2's content is stable.
